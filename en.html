                            Hello, my name is  <span>Luan</span>. Currently, I am a young apprentice at the company <a href="https://gazin.com.br/"
                            id="gazin" target="_blank"><i>Gazin</i></a>, in the IT (Information Technology) area, in the city of Douradina, Paraná. I'm 17 years old and I'm here to show you a little of what I learned in these first months of work, and talk a little about it. When I arrived here for the first time, I was surprised. I thought it was an extremely contracted place, but it's actually the opposite of that. The staff is focused and participative. In the short time that I've been working here, I've already managed to learn some interesting things.

                            &nbsp;Even before I have delved into this field, I see that a large and vast sea of ​​opportunities opens up before me. Several different areas, in different ways, for different people. So many languages, and each time it tends to increase.
                            Today we live in a world where it is almost impossible to survive without the internet. People spend more time looking at screens than at themselves. So, imagine the power and responsibility of those who control and develop these areas? Without a doubt, it is something extremely great.

But unfortunately, no matter what you do, we will never be "safe", unfortunately.

Unlike black hats who act maliciously, white hats contribute to the security of the internet and computer systems. In today's digital world where cyber threats are constantly evolving, white hats play a crucial role in protecting our data and infrastructure. They help organizations stay ahead of attackers and prevent security breaches. sometimes also called "ethical hackers" or "good hackers" are the antithesis of black hats. They explore computer systems or networks to identify their security flaws so they can make recommendations for improvement. It is essential to understand the difference between white hat hackers and black hat hackers. While white hats help improve cybersecurity and protect organizations, black hats pose a serious threat to online privacy. Promoting ethics in cybersecurity and collaborating with white hat professionals is essential to protect our systems and data in an increasingly digitalized world.

They may use hacking techniques to find security vulnerabilities, but they don't always follow the rules. For example, a gray hat hacker may break into a computer system without permission but then report the vulnerability to the system owner.

Not even large companies have complete control over this. The acronym can also be accompanied by another “D”: DDoS which, in English, is the abbreviation for Distributed Denial of Service or distributed denial of service attack, in Portuguese. When a denial of service attack is distributed, it means that several machines are used to make simultaneous requests.
